A single breach can cost weeks of downtime, lost clients, or GDPR fines. Most protections — like training and MFA — are low-cost or free.\n\n## 7. ✅ \"We did a training once, so we’re covered\"\n\n**Reality:** One-and-done training isn’t enough. Threats evolve.

Here’s how to lock them down:\n\n- Use a strong login password (not just a screensaver)\n- Always lock your screen (Win+L or Cmd+Ctrl+Q) before stepping away\n- Set your device to auto-lock after 5–10 minutes\n- Keep software updated — including your OS, browser, and key apps\n- Encrypt your hard drive (e.g., BitLocker or FileVault)\n\n## 📱 Phones and Tablets Deserve Protection Too\n\nPhones often store work emails, logins, and documents. Treat them like laptops:\n\n- Use a PIN, fingerprint, or Face ID to lock your device\n- Turn off Bluetooth and AirDrop when not needed\n- Enable remote wipe in case the device is lost\n- Avoid jailbreaking or using unofficial apps\n\n## 🌐 Remote Work? Don’t Skip These Wi-Fi Rules\n\nPublic and home Wi-Fi can expose your traffic to snoopers:\n\n- Never use public Wi-Fi without a VPN\n- Prefer personal mobile hotspots when traveling\n- Don’t sync work files to personal cloud drives\n- Only use work-approved devices and accounts\n\n## 🚫 What NOT to Do (Yes, We’ve Seen These)\n\n- Don’t leave laptops unattended in cars\n- Don’t let family members use your work device\n- Don’t share login details via email or chat\n- Don’t use USB drives you didn’t purchase yourself\n\n## 🧳 If Your Device Is Lost or Stolen…\n\nSpeed matters.

And yet, password hygiene is still a major weak point for small teams.\n\nHere are the top 5 mistakes — and what to do instead.\n\n## ❌ Mistake #1: Reusing Passwords Across Tools\nIf your email and accounting platform share a password, one breach opens the door to everything.\n\n**Fix**: Use a different, strong password for each app. Password managers make this easy.\n\n## ❌ Mistake #2: Using Personal Info (Names, Pets, Birthdays)\nAttackers can guess or find this info easily — especially on social media.\n\n**Fix**: Create random passwords with a mix of characters — or use passphrases like \"&Banana/Jump7*Track\".\n\n## ❌ Mistake #3: Storing Passwords in Plaintext\nNotepad files, email drafts, or sticky notes are not secure.\n\n**Fix**: Use a password manager like Bitwarden or 1Password. Store recovery codes safely.\n\n## ❌ Mistake #4: Ignoring MFA Setup\nMFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) blocks over 99% of automated attacks — but too many skip it.\n\n**Fix**: Turn on MFA for email, cloud tools, banking, and payroll.\n\n## ❌ Mistake #5: Sharing Credentials With Colleagues\nIt might seem convenient, but it's risky and non-compliant.\n\n**Fix**: Create individual logins. If needed, use shared vaults in a business password manager.\n\n## ✅ Quick Win Checklist\n- ✅ Use 12+ character passwords\n- ✅ Don’t reuse them\n- ✅ Turn on MFA\n- ✅ Use a manager\n- ✅ Never share them\n\n> \"You lock your office door.
