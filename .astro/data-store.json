Here’s how to lock them down:\n\n- Use a strong login password (not just a screensaver)\n- Always lock your screen (Win+L or Cmd+Ctrl+Q) before stepping away\n- Set your device to auto-lock after 5–10 minutes\n- Keep software updated — including your OS, browser, and key apps\n- Encrypt your hard drive (e.g., BitLocker or FileVault)\n\n## 📱 Phones and Tablets Deserve Protection Too\n\nPhones often store work emails, logins, and documents. Treat them like laptops:\n\n- Use a PIN, fingerprint, or Face ID to lock your device\n- Turn off Bluetooth and AirDrop when not needed\n- Enable remote wipe in case the device is lost\n- Avoid jailbreaking or using unofficial apps\n\n## 🌐 Remote Work? Don’t Skip These Wi-Fi Rules\n\nPublic and home Wi-Fi can expose your traffic to snoopers:\n\n- Never use public Wi-Fi without a VPN\n- Prefer personal mobile hotspots when traveling\n- Don’t sync work files to personal cloud drives\n- Only use work-approved devices and accounts\n\n## 🚫 What NOT to Do (Yes, We’ve Seen These)\n\n- Don’t leave laptops unattended in cars\n- Don’t let family members use your work device\n- Don’t share login details via email or chat\n- Don’t use USB drives you didn’t purchase yourself\n\n## 🧳 If Your Device Is Lost or Stolen…\n\nSpeed matters.
