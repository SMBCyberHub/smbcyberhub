It only takes seconds for a child, roommate, or stranger in a café to access your files.\n\n- Windows: Press `Win + L`\n- macOS: Press `Ctrl + Cmd + Q`\n\n**Bonus**: Enable auto-lock after 5–10 minutes of inactivity.\n\n## 🌐 Avoid Public Wi-Fi (Unless You Use a VPN)\nPublic networks can be spoofed or monitored.\n\n- Use mobile hotspots or VPNs when on the move\n- Avoid logging into work tools over café Wi-Fi\n\n## 🚫 Don’t Let Family Use Your Work Devices\nShared use increases risk of misclicks, malware, or policy violations. Even on weekends.\n\n## 🧼 Keep Devices Updated\nOutdated operating systems, browsers, and apps are major risk vectors.\n\n- Turn on auto-updates\n- Install patches regularly\n\n## 📲 Treat Your Phone Like a Laptop\nPhones often hold work email, files, logins.
