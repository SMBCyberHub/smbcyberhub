  <h1>Audit-Ready in Under an Hour: A Cyber Hygiene Checklist</h1>
  <p class="post-date">July 6, 2025</p>
  <p>Client asking for proof of training? GDPR review coming up? This fast checklist helps small teams get cyber hygiene in order ‚Äî without a consultant.</p>

  <p><strong>This article is a deep dive into the 10 most crucial cybersecurity steps a small business can take to prepare for an audit or simply improve its security posture.</strong> We'll explain each step and provide actionable advice to help your team implement it quickly.</p>
  
  
  <h2>üßæ 10-Point Audit-Readiness Checklist</h2>

  <h3>1. ‚úÖ Acceptable Use Policy</h3>
  <p>An acceptable use policy (AUP) is a foundational security document. It's a set of rules and guidelines that employees must follow when using company technology and assets. This is often a key requirement for compliance and is one of the first things an auditor will ask to see.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Define what‚Äôs allowed on work devices</li>
    <li>Include rules for personal use, USBs, and software installs</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For more details on this topic, see our related post on <a href="/posts/acceptable-use-policy-for-small-business">Creating an Acceptable Use Policy</a>. </p>

  <h3>2. ‚úÖ Security Awareness Training</h3>
  <p>Employees are often the weakest link in a company's security. Regular training helps them recognize and avoid threats. It's not enough to have a policy; you must prove your team has been trained on it.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Phishing, password hygiene, and device safety</li>
    <li>Quizzes or logs to document completion</li>
  </ul>
