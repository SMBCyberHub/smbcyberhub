Small teams don’t need enterprise tools to spot most email threats.  
What they need is a **repeatable, 5-minute routine** that reduces the risk of phishing clicks, payment fraud, and account compromise.

This guide gives your staff a **simple inbox-security workflow** they can follow every morning—no jargon, no tech skills.

## Why a Routine Works

Almost every major small-business attack — invoice fraud, gift-card scams, fake bank-detail changes, account takeovers — starts with a **single email**.  
A consistent daily routine catches the signs early.

…this routine builds on those foundations and gives your team a predictable process to follow.

## The 5-Minute Inbox Security Routine

### 1. Check the sender domain (not just the name)
Attackers rely on display-name deception.

Look at the actual address and confirm it’s an **exact match**, letter for letter.

If you haven’t seen how close lookalikes can get, see:  
**[Stop Fake Emails: Spoofing vs Lookalikes](/posts/stop-fake-emails-spoofing-lookalikes)**.

### 2. Hover every link before clicking
Before clicking anything, hover (or long-press on mobile) and check that the link:

- matches the text shown,  
- uses the exact domain you expect,  
- doesn’t hide behind shortened or disguised tracking links.

### 3. Pause on urgency or emotional pressure
Fake “CEO requests”, surprise invoices, and payment-change scams all attempt to:

- rush you,  
- alarm you, or  
- flatter you.

If an email triggers urgency, escalate it.  
If it’s money-related, follow the **verify-before-pay rule** from our post:  
**[Stop Payment Fraud: A Simple Callback Playbook](/posts/stop-payment-fraud-simple-callback-playbook)**.

### 4. Check shared mailboxes carefully
Billing@, accounts@, support@, and sales@ are attacker favorites.

Daily checks should include:

- unexpected forwarding rules,  
- replies sent that you didn’t write,  
- messages marked as read that the team doesn’t recognize.

### 5. Report anything odd immediately
Make it easy for staff to escalate suspicious messages.

A simple internal option is:

- forward suspicious emails to your shared security inbox (e.g., security@yourcompany.com), or  
- use your email client’s built-in "Report Phishing" button.

Anything that “just feels off” is worth reporting.

## Extra Wins That Make This Routine Even Stronger

### Turn on SPF, DKIM, and DMARC
These settings stop attackers from spoofing your real domain.

### Show the full sender address in the inbox list
Many email clients hide the address by default.  
Turn this on for better visual checks.

### Add an external-sender banner
“External” banners are simple and reduce social engineering clicks significantly.

### Enforce a call-back verification for any money movement
Email alone must never be enough to approve a payment.

## Quick FAQ

**Is this enough to stop all phishing?**  
No routine stops everything, but this removes a large percentage of opportunistic attacks.

**Do we need new tools?**  
Not to start. Most improvements come from behaviour, not software.

**Should we train the whole team on this?**  
Yes. This is designed so non-technical staff can follow it daily.
