Someone on your team clicked a phishing email. Now what?

Here’s what actually happens behind the scenes — and what to do next to limit damage.

## 🐛 Step 1: Malware or Credential Theft Begins
Phishing emails usually contain:

- A link to a fake login page (to steal passwords)
- A malicious attachment (that installs malware or ransomware)

## 🚨 Step 2: The Attacker Gains Access
If a password is entered or malware runs, the attacker may:

- Log in to cloud apps
- View or download files
- Install further payloads
- Attempt internal phishing from the compromised account

## 🔍 Step 3: You Discover It (or the Attacker Slips)
Signs of a phishing click:
- Unusual login location notifications
- Colleagues receiving suspicious emails from you
- Files disappearing or being encrypted

## ✅ Immediate Response Checklist
1. **Disconnect the device from the internet**
2. **Change passwords for any accounts accessed on the device**
3. **Notify your manager or IT/security contact**
4. **Document the event and any steps taken**
5. **Check backups and start forensic analysis if needed**

## 💡 Tips for Prevention Next Time
- Don’t punish the user — train them
- Encourage early reporting over silence
- Use email security tools with phishing protection
- Enable MFA on all major tools

> “It’s not about blame. It’s about response time.”
