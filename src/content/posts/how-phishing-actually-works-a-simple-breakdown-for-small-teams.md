Phishing is still the #1 cause of small business data breaches — and it's not just about bad grammar or spam filters. Here's how phishing really works, and how your team can stop falling for it.

## 🎣 What Is Phishing?
Phishing is when attackers impersonate a trusted source (like your bank, IT partner, or CEO) to trick you into:

- Clicking a malicious link
- Downloading malware
- Entering your login credentials on a fake page

It's called "phishing" because attackers throw out bait and hope someone bites. Unlike traditional fishing, these attackers are casting thousands of lines simultaneously, hoping to catch as many victims as possible.

### Why Phishing Works So Well
- **Trust exploitation**: Attackers use familiar names and logos
- **Psychological pressure**: Urgency and fear tactics
- **Human nature**: People want to be helpful and responsive
- **Information overload**: Busy employees don't scrutinize every email

## 📬 Real SMB Examples
### Common Phishing Scenarios Targeting Small Businesses

#### **Cloud Storage Scam**
```
From: Microsoft 365 Team <security@microsoft365-update.com>
Subject: Your storage is almost full - Upgrade now

Your OneDrive account has reached 95% capacity. 
Files will be deleted in 24 hours unless you upgrade.

[Upgrade Storage] [Delete Old Files]
```

#### **Fake Invoice Attack**
```
From: Accounts Payable <billing@acme-corp.net>
Subject: Invoice #2026-0142 - Payment Required

Please remit payment to our new bank details:
Bank: National Business Bank
Account: 4567890123
Sort Code: 40-20-30

Amount: €2,450.00
Due: Today
```

#### **CEO Fraud**
```
From: John Smith <ceo@company.com>
Subject: Urgent - Confidential Matter

I need you to purchase 5 €200 gift cards immediately for a client meeting.
Reply with the card codes - this is time sensitive.
Don't discuss with anyone.
```

#### **IT Department Impersonation**
```
From: IT Support <it-support@company.tech>
Subject: Password Expiration Notice

Your password will expire in 1 hour.
Log in to reset your password immediately:
[https://company-security-reset.com/login]

Failure to update will result in account suspension.
```

These are common — and they often work because they exploit trust and create urgency.

## 🚩 Red Flags to Look For
### Sender Analysis
- **Unusual sender address**: Check the actual email address, not just the display name
- **Mismatched domains**: Microsoft emails should come from microsoft.com, not microsoft365-update.com
- **Slight variations**: company.com vs. company.co or company-inc.com

### Content Warning Signs
- **Urgency tactics**: "You must act within 24 hours!" "Immediate action required"
- **Threats**: "Account will be suspended" "Files will be deleted"
- **Unusual requests**: Gift cards, wire transfers, credential sharing
- **Poor grammar**: Spelling mistakes, awkward phrasing (though getting better)

### Technical Red Flags
- **Suspicious links**: Hover over links to see actual destination
- **Unusual attachments**: ZIP files, .exe, .scr files
- **Mismatched URLs**: Link text shows one destination, actual link goes elsewhere
- **No personalization**: Generic greetings like "Dear User" instead of your name

### Behavioral Red Flags
- **Unexpected requests**: Sudden changes in payment methods
- **Unusual timing**: Requests outside normal business hours
- **Bypassing procedures**: "Don't discuss with anyone" "Keep this confidential"
- **Pressure tactics**: "This is time sensitive" "Act immediately"

## ✅ What to Do Instead
### Immediate Response Protocol

#### **Step 1: Pause and Verify**
- **Stop**: Don't click, download, or respond immediately
- **Think**: Does this request make sense?
- **Verify**: Contact the person through a trusted channel

#### **Step 2: Technical Verification**
- **Check sender**: Right-click email → "Show original" to see actual sender
- **Hover links**: Check actual destination before clicking
- **Scan attachments**: Use antivirus software before opening

#### **Step 3: Human Verification**
- **Call them**: Use a known phone number, not one in the email
- **Visit in person**: For internal requests, verify face-to-face
- **Use official channels**: Company chat, official email address

#### **Step 4: Report and Delete**
- **Report**: Use "Report Phishing" button in Outlook or Gmail
- **Delete**: Remove the email to prevent accidental clicks
- **Document**: Keep a record of the attempt for security awareness

### Verification Examples

#### **Fake Invoice Verification**
```
Email: "Please pay to new bank account"
Action: Call vendor using known phone number
Question: "Did you change your bank details recently?"
Result: "No, that's a phishing attempt"
```

#### **CEO Fraud Verification**
```
Email: "Buy gift cards immediately"
Action: Walk to CEO's office or call their mobile
Question: "Did you ask for gift cards?"
Result: "No, report this to IT immediately"
```

## 📋 Phishing Prevention Checklist
### Daily Habits for Your Team

#### **Before Opening Emails**
- [ ] Check sender address carefully
- [ ] Look for urgency or threats
- [ ] Verify unusual requests
- [ ] Scan for grammar mistakes

## 🎯 Key Takeaways
### Remember These Rules

4. **When in doubt, ask**: Better to verify than to be compromised
5. **Report everything**: Help protect others by reporting attempts

### Your Action Plan
- [ ] Implement email verification procedures
- [ ] Conduct monthly phishing awareness training
