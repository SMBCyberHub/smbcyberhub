# What Insurers Expect to See in Cybersecurity Training Records

<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-emerald-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-8 rounded-lg">

### 📋 TL;DR Summary

**For 2026 cyber insurance audits, insurers expect 5 specific training records:**

1. **Training completion roster** with employee names, dates, and signatures
2. **Training content outline** showing what topics were covered
3. **Quiz/test results** proving comprehension (minimum 80% pass rate)
4. **Attendance logs** with timestamps for each training session
5. **Annual refresher schedule** showing planned ongoing training

**Without these records, insurers can deny claims or increase premiums by 30-50%.** Our kit provides all 5 templates plus the training materials.

## The Insurance Audit Reality Check

When your cyber insurance policy comes up for renewal, the insurer will ask for proof of cybersecurity training. They're not just checking a box — they're verifying that your team actually understands security basics.

**What happens if you can't provide proper records:**
- Claims may be denied for "failure to implement reasonable security measures"
- Premiums can increase 30-50% at renewal
- Coverage may be reduced or excluded entirely
- You may be required to complete expensive remedial training

## The 5 Essential Training Records Insurers Demand

### 1. Training Completion Roster

**What insurers want:** A signed roster showing every employee who completed training.

**Must include:**
- Employee full names
- Training completion date
- Employee signature (or digital acknowledgment)
- Trainer/facilitator signature
- Training method (in-person, online, hybrid)

**Why it matters:** Proves you actually trained your team, not just bought a course.

### 2. Training Content Outline

**What insurers want:** A detailed syllabus of what was covered.

**Must include:**
- Specific topics covered (phishing, passwords, data protection, etc.)
- Duration of each training module
- Training materials used (slides, videos, handouts)
- Learning objectives for each section

**Why it matters:** Shows the training was comprehensive and relevant to your risks.

### 3. Quiz/Test Results

**What insurers want:** Proof that employees understood the training.

**Must include:**
- Quiz questions and answers
- Individual employee scores (minimum 80% pass rate)
- Date of assessment
- Retake records for anyone who failed initially

**Why it matters:** Demonstrates comprehension, not just attendance.

### 4. Attendance Logs

**What insurers want:** Detailed logs showing who attended and when.

**Must include:**
- Session start and end times
- Check-in/check-out times for each employee
- Method of attendance verification
- Any absences or make-up sessions

**Why it matters:** Proves employees actually attended the full training.

### 5. Annual Refresher Schedule

**What insurers want:** Evidence of ongoing training commitment.

**Must include:**
- Planned annual training dates
- Topics for refresher training
- Schedule for new employee onboarding
- Process for updating training content

**Why it matters:** Shows cybersecurity is an ongoing priority, not a one-time event.

## Common Mistakes That Get Claims Denied

### ❌ "We Sent Everyone a Link to an Online Course"
**Problem:** No proof of completion or comprehension.
**Solution:** Use our training completion roster and quiz templates.

### ❌ "Our IT Manager Did the Training"
**Problem:** No documentation of what was covered or who attended.
**Solution:** Use our content outline and attendance log templates.

### ❌ "We Have Email Confirmations"
**Problem:** Insurers consider this insufficient proof.
**Solution:** Use our signed acknowledgment forms and quiz results.

### ❌ "Training Was 2 Years Ago"
**Problem:** Most policies require annual training.
**Solution:** Use our annual refresher schedule template.
