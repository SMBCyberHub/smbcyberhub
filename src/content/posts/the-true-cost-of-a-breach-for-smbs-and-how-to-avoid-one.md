A breach doesn’t just hit your inbox — it hits your bank account, reputation, and client trust. Here’s what a breach really costs small businesses — and how to avoid one.

## 💸 Direct Financial Costs
- Regulatory fines (GDPR, ICO, etc.)
- IT forensics and recovery
- Emergency legal fees
- PR or crisis communications support

Even a minor breach can run €5,000–€15,000 in costs.

## ⏱️ Business Downtime
- Loss of access to files and systems
- Missed client deadlines or sales opportunities
- Increased pressure on your team

Downtime is expensive — especially if you rely on remote access or cloud platforms.

## 💔 Trust and Reputation Damage
- Clients lose confidence
- Leads dry up
- Future sales slow down

The worst part? Many SMBs aren’t aware a breach has happened until it’s too late.

## ✅ How to Avoid a Breach
- Use strong passwords + MFA on all accounts
- Train staff on phishing, device safety, and scams
- Encrypt devices and cloud data
- Keep regular, offsite backups
- Use your SMBCyberHub kit to document awareness

## 📊 Bonus: Insurance Benefits
Many cyber insurers now require documented training, policies, and breach response plans. Show that you’re audit-ready.

> “A single laptop or email account breach can cost more than your entire annual security budget.”
