Not every small team can afford one device per person — but sharing devices shouldn't mean sharing security risks. Here's how to strike the balance between security and productivity.

## 👩‍💻 Why Shared Devices Create Risk

### The Hidden Dangers of Device Sharing
When multiple people use the same computer, you're not just sharing hardware — you're sharing access to data, accounts, and security controls.

#### **Security Risks:**
- **No clear audit trail** of who accessed what and when
- **Saved logins or cached data** remain visible to all users
- **Accidental deletion** of important files or settings
- **Policy violations** from unauthorized software installations
- **Cross-contamination** of personal and business data

#### **Business Impact:**
- **Data breaches** from unauthorized access
- **Compliance violations** (GDPR, industry regulations)
- **Productivity loss** from security incidents
- **Legal liability** from data exposure

#### **Real-World Examples:**
- A receptionist accidentally accesses HR files left open by a colleague
- Contractors see confidential client proposals from previous users
- Part-time staff download personal software onto business devices
- Shared laptops contain cached passwords to multiple cloud services

## 🔐 Security Practices That Still Allow Flexibility

### **Create Separate User Accounts**
The foundation of shared device security is individual accountability.

#### **Implementation:**
- **Create unique accounts** for each person using the device
- **Use standard naming convention** (e.g., "jsmith-reception", "jdoe-contractor")
- **Set appropriate permissions** based on role and responsibilities
- **Document account assignments** in a shared spreadsheet or system

#### **Benefits:**
- **Clear audit trail** of who accessed what
- **Individual accountability** for actions
- **Role-based access** to sensitive data
- **Easy to disable** when someone leaves

#### **Best Practices:**
```
Account Structure:
- Reception Staff: reception-01, reception-02
- Contractors: contractor-[company]-[name]
- Temporary Staff: temp-[date]-[initials]
- Admin Access: admin-[role]-[name]
```

### **Use Browser Profiles for Session Separation**
Modern browsers make it easy to keep work and personal data separate.

#### **Chrome Profiles:**
- **Create profiles** for each user: "John Smith - Reception", "Jane Doe - Contractor"
- **Separate bookmarks**, history, and saved passwords
- **Sync settings** disabled for shared devices
- **Auto-fill** limited to work-related accounts

#### **Firefox Containers:**
- **Use containers** for different work contexts
- **Separate cookies** and site data
- **Color-coded tabs** for easy identification
- **Container-specific** bookmarks and passwords

#### **Implementation Steps:**
1. **Open browser settings**
2. **Create new profile/container** for each user
3. **Set unique profile picture** for easy identification
4. **Disable sync** for shared devices
5. **Test login/logout** procedures

### **Implement Session Cleanup Procedures**
End-of-session cleanup prevents data leakage between users.

#### **Browser Cleanup:**
- **Clear history** and cache after each session
- **Log out of all web applications** (email, cloud storage, CRM)
- **Close all tabs** and windows
- **Clear downloads** and trash folders

#### **System Cleanup:**
- **Log out of Windows/Mac** account
- **Lock screen** when stepping away
- **Save work** to appropriate cloud storage
- **Remove temporary files** and local copies

#### **Automation Options:**
- **Browser extensions** that auto-clear on close
- **Scripts** that run cleanup commands
- **Scheduled tasks** for regular maintenance

## 📂 For Shared Workstations

### **Physical Security Controls**
Shared workstations need additional protection since they're accessible to multiple people.

#### **USB Port Management:**
- **Disable unused USB ports** through BIOS/UEFI settings
- **Use USB port locks** for critical ports
- **Allow only approved USB devices** (company-encrypted drives)
- **Monitor USB activity** with device management software

#### **Software Installation Control:**
- **Set users as standard users** (not administrators)
- **Require admin approval** for new software
- **Use application whitelisting** for approved programs
- **Block unauthorized** installation attempts

#### **Activity Logging:**
- **Enable Windows Event Logs** or macOS logging
- **Track login/logout times** and user accounts
- **Monitor application usage** and file access
- **Regular review** of security logs

#### **Implementation Checklist:**
```
Workstation Security Setup:
□ Disable USB ports (except keyboard/mouse)
□ Set all users to standard accounts
□ Enable Windows Defender/Windows Security
□ Configure automatic updates
□ Set up activity logging
□ Create admin procedures manual
□ Test user switching procedures
```

## 🧠 Policy Development

### **Acceptable Use Policy for Shared Devices**
Create clear guidelines that everyone can understand and follow.

#### **Key Policy Elements:**
- **Device access hours** and usage restrictions
- **Account management** procedures
- **Data handling** requirements
- **Security responsibilities** for each user
- **Incident reporting** procedures

#### **Sample Policy Language:**
```
Shared Device Use Policy
1. Individual user accounts are required for all device access
2. Password sharing is strictly prohibited
3. Users must log out completely after each session
4. No personal software installation without approval
5. All work must be saved to company cloud storage
6. Report security incidents immediately to management
7. Device sharing does not override data protection policies
```

### **Integration with Existing Policies**
Ensure shared device policies align with your broader security framework.

#### **Related Policies:**
- **Acceptable Use Policy** (general guidelines)
- **Data Protection Policy** (GDPR compliance)
- **Incident Response Plan** (what to do when things go wrong)
- **Remote Work Policy** (if applicable)

#### **Cross-Reference Your Existing Content:**
Your shared device policy should reference related blog posts:
- [Quarterly Access Reviews in 20 Minutes](/posts/quarterly-access-reviews-small-team-playbook/)
- [Device Security Basics](/posts/device-security-basics/)
- [Remote Work Security Habits](/posts/remote-work-security-habits-that-stop-data-leaks-before-they-start/)
