Not every small team can afford one device per person — but sharing devices shouldn’t mean sharing security risks. Here’s how to strike the balance.

## 👩‍💻 Why Shared Devices Create Risk
- No clear audit trail of who accessed what
- Saved logins or cached data remain visible
- Accidental deletion, download, or policy violation

## 🔐 Security Practices That Still Allow Flexibility
- Create **separate user accounts** for each person
- Use **browser profiles** to separate logins and sessions
- Clear browser history and cache after each use
- Require screen lock and session timeout

## 📂 For Shared Workstations
- Disable USB ports (or use locks)
- Block software installations without admin approval
- Log activity on shared machines if possible

## 🧠 Policy Tip
If devices are shared among rotating staff (like receptionists or contractors), make this part of your Acceptable Use Policy.

> “Device sharing should never mean password sharing.”

## ✅ Team Checklist
- No shared passwords
- Log out between sessions
- Don’t save passwords in browsers
- Clear downloads and trash folders
- Set device lock after inactivity
