Strong passwords are one of the simplest, most effective defenses in cybersecurity. And yet, password hygiene is still a major weak point for small teams.

Here are the top 5 mistakes — and what to do instead.

## ❌ Mistake #1: Reusing Passwords Across Tools
If your email and accounting platform share a password, one breach opens the door to everything.

**Fix**: Use a different, strong password for each app. Password managers make this easy.

## ❌ Mistake #2: Using Personal Info (Names, Pets, Birthdays)
Attackers can guess or find this info easily — especially on social media.

**Fix**: Create random passwords with a mix of characters — or use passphrases like "&Banana/Jump7*Track".

## ❌ Mistake #3: Storing Passwords in Plaintext
Notepad files, email drafts, or sticky notes are not secure.

**Fix**: Use a password manager like Bitwarden or 1Password. Store recovery codes safely.

## ❌ Mistake #4: Ignoring MFA Setup
MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) blocks over 99% of automated attacks — but too many skip it.

**Fix**: Turn on MFA for email, cloud tools, banking, and payroll.

## ❌ Mistake #5: Sharing Credentials With Colleagues
It might seem convenient, but it's risky and non-compliant.

**Fix**: Create individual logins. If needed, use shared vaults in a business password manager.

## ✅ Quick Win Checklist
- ✅ Use 12+ character passwords
- ✅ Don’t reuse them
- ✅ Turn on MFA
- ✅ Use a manager
- ✅ Never share them
