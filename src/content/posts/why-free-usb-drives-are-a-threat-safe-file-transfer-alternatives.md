Free USB drives might seem like harmless swag — but they can be serious security threats. For small teams, the risk is even greater.

## 🛑 Why USB Drives Are Dangerous
- They can carry hidden malware
- They may trigger autorun scripts when plugged in
- Their origin (and prior use) is unknown

Even if the drive seems new, it could have been tampered with.

## 🎯 Real SMB Risk Scenarios
- A vendor hands out USBs at a conference — one is infected with ransomware
- A staff member plugs in a "found" drive to locate the owner — malware spreads
- A used drive shared between work and home computers leaks data

## 🔐 Safer Alternatives to USB Drives
- Use secure cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive)
- Use encrypted file-sharing tools (like Tresorit or ProtonDrive)
- Share links with expiring access or password protection

## 🧠 Train Your Team
Make it policy: **Never plug in unknown USBs.**

And don’t share personal drives between devices — even inside the company.

> "If you didn’t buy it, don’t plug it."

## ✅ Checklist
- Use cloud storage or secure file links
- Avoid free or shared USB drives
- Disable USB autorun on all devices
- Consider USB port locks for shared workstations
