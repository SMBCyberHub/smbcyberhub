Working remotely is here to stay. But without the right habits, remote work can expose sensitive data — from lost devices to unsafe networks.

Here are simple, powerful habits your team should adopt.

## � The Remote Work Security Challenge

### **Why Remote Work Increases Risk**
Remote work introduces unique security challenges that office-based work doesn't face.

#### **Physical Security Risks:**
- **Device theft**: Laptops and phones can be stolen from homes, cars, or public places
- **Shoulder surfing**: People can view sensitive information over shoulders
- **Public exposure**: Working in cafes, airports, or co-working spaces
- **Home security**: Family members, roommates, or visitors can access devices

#### **Network Security Risks:**
- **Public Wi-Fi**: Unsecured networks in cafes, hotels, airports
- **Home networks**: Often less secure than office networks
- **Mobile hotspots**: Can be intercepted or monitored
- **VPN limitations**: Not all VPNs are created equal

#### **Device Security Risks:**
- **Personal device mixing**: Using personal devices for work
- **Outdated software**: Delayed updates on personal devices
- **Insufficient security**: Personal devices may lack security software
- **Data mixing**: Personal and work data on same device

#### **Human Factor Risks:**
- **Distraction**: Home environments have more distractions
- **Complacency**: Feeling too safe at home
- **Family access**: Family members may accidentally access work data
- **Password sharing**: May share passwords with family members
