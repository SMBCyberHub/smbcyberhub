Working remotely is here to stay. But without the right habits, remote work can expose sensitive data — from lost devices to unsafe networks.

Here are simple, powerful habits your team should adopt.

## 🔐 Lock Devices Every Time You Walk Away
Even at home. It only takes seconds for a child, roommate, or stranger in a café to access your files.

- Windows: Press `Win + L`
- macOS: Press `Ctrl + Cmd + Q`

**Bonus**: Enable auto-lock after 5–10 minutes of inactivity.

## 🌐 Avoid Public Wi-Fi (Unless You Use a VPN)
Public networks can be spoofed or monitored.

- Use mobile hotspots or VPNs when on the move
- Avoid logging into work tools over café Wi-Fi

## 🚫 Don’t Let Family Use Your Work Devices
Shared use increases risk of misclicks, malware, or policy violations. Even on weekends.

## 🧼 Keep Devices Updated
Outdated operating systems, browsers, and apps are major risk vectors.

- Turn on auto-updates
- Install patches regularly

## 📲 Treat Your Phone Like a Laptop
Phones often hold work email, files, logins. Secure them.

- Use PIN, Face ID, or fingerprint lock
- Enable remote wipe
- Don’t install apps from unknown sources

## ✅ Remote Work Security Checklist
- Lock screens & enable auto-lock
- Use VPN or hotspot when remote
- No personal use of work devices
- Apply updates weekly
- Secure phones too
