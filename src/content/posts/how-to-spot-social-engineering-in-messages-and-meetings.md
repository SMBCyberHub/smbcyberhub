Technology isn’t always the weakest link — people are. Social engineering attacks use manipulation, not malware, to get what they want. Here’s how to protect your team.

## 🎭 What Is Social Engineering?
It’s when attackers trick people into doing something risky:

- Sharing a password
- Paying a fake invoice
- Clicking a link or downloading malware

They often pose as someone you trust: a manager, coworker, supplier, or even "IT support."

## 🚨 Common Tactics
- **Urgency**: “You must act NOW!”
- **Impersonation**: “I’m the CFO. Please send this payment.”
- **Authority pressure**: “I need your help — this is time-sensitive.”
- **Emotional manipulation**: “We’ll lose the client if we delay.”

## 💬 Real Examples
- "Hi, it’s Sarah from IT. Can you reset your login here?"
- "This invoice is overdue. Pay by end of day or risk penalty."
- "Quick question — can you confirm your phone number for payroll?"

All of these can be fake.

## ✅ How to Verify Safely
- Call the person using a **known number** — not one in the message
- Check sender details carefully (email address, domain, tone)
- Confirm sensitive requests with a manager
- Never rush. Urgency is a red flag, not a reason

## 🔐 Train Your Team to Be Skeptical
Use SMBCyberHub’s Social Engineering Quiz to test staff and build awareness.

> “Trust but verify” isn’t enough. In cybersecurity, it’s “Verify first, then act.”

## 📋 Social Engineering Defense Checklist
- Don’t trust unknown calls or emails
- Verify money or login requests
- Don’t click links in suspicious messages
- Report anything that feels off
