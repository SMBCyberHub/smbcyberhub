Hiring someone new? Great. The first week is when good security habits stick (or don’t). This simple plan gets a new starter set up safely **without** turning day one into an IT saga.

> **Goal:** Create the right accounts, set the right permissions, and build 3 essential habits: strong passwords, MFA, and quick reporting.

---

## ✅ Day 0 (Before They Start)
**Create only what they need for week one.**
- **Account setup:** Email + core tools (calendar, docs, chat, CRM/accounting if relevant).
- **Groups/roles:** Add them to team groups (e.g., “Sales-EU”, “Ops-APAC”) — avoid giving “All Admin” access.
- **MFA required:** Enforce MFA on first login (app-based or hardware key).
- **Device ready:** Issue a laptop with auto-lock (5–10 mins), full-disk encryption, and automatic updates enabled.
- **Welcome note:** Send a friendly “how we do security” message and the checklist below.

Why it matters: Least-privilege access prevents accidental data exposure and keeps you compliant with client/insurer expectations. MFA blocks the most common account-takeover routes.

---

## ✅ Day 1 (First Login)
**Make access simple, safe, and successful.**
- **Password manager:** Install and show how to use it (unique, long passwords — no sharing).
- **MFA set-up check:** Confirm the authenticator works and capture **one** secure recovery method.
- **Phishing basics (5 mins):** Show one real example; agree on your “report suspicious” path (Slack/Teams/email).

Tip: Keep it human — “If you’re unsure, ask. Reporting early is always OK.”

---

## ✅ Day 2 (Tools & Files)
**Share the right stuff, the right way.**
- **Shared drives/folders:** Add to the team’s working areas; avoid private doc silos.
- **Calendar & comms:** Subscribe them to team calendars; set channel norms (what to share where).
- **Client data rules:** Plain-English dos/don’ts (no personal cloud, no unknown USBs, no forwarding to personal email).

Outcome: Work flows from day two, without scattering files across personal devices or inboxes.

---

## ✅ Day 3 (Device Confidence)
**Lock it down without killing productivity.**
- **Auto-lock & updates:** Confirm screen lock is active and OS/browser updates are automatic.
- **Mobile access:** If using a phone for work email, ensure screen lock + remote-wipe are enabled.
- **Backups:** Verify docs live in shared storage or are auto-backed up (no “desktop only” files).

Reason: Most small-team incidents come from lost devices or exposed files — these steps remove that risk early.

---

## ✅ Day 4 (Access Review in 10 Minutes)
**Right level, no oversharing.**
- Check they can access everything needed for *this* role.
- Remove any extra access accidentally granted (test links for “Anyone with link” and fix to “Team”).
- For shared mailboxes/API keys, store credentials in the manager — never a note or DM.

Outcome: Least privilege from week one — and fewer surprises later.

---

## ✅ Day 5 (Quick Practice & “What If”)
**One tiny exercise beats a 30-slide deck.**
- **Two-minute drill:** Ask them to “report a suspicious email” using your agreed path.
- **Mini-scenario:** “If you lose your laptop/phone, what’s step one?” (Answer: tell us immediately; we’ll remote-lock/wipe.)
- **Wrap-up:** Remind them that mistakes are reported, not hidden — speed matters, not blame.

---

## 📌 Ongoing (Set It and Forget It)
- **Monthly:** Manager checks access for their team (adds/removes as roles change).
- **Quarterly:** Rotate any shared passwords/API tokens still in use.
- **When they change roles:** Review permissions the same week — don’t wait.
