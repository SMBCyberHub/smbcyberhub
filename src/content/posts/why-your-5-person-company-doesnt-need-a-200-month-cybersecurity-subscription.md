# Why Your 5-Person Company Doesn't Need a $200/Month Cybersecurity Subscription

**Paying $200+ per month for cybersecurity software?** You're wasting $2,400 per year on features you don't need. Here's the math that proves your 5-person company can achieve better compliance with a one-time purchase.

## 💰 **The Hidden Cost of Cybersecurity SaaS**

### **What You're Actually Paying For:**
- **$200/month** = $2,400 per year
- **$300/month** = $3,600 per year  
- **$500/month** = $6,000 per year

**Over 5 years: $12,000-$30,000** for features designed for 100+ employee companies.

### **The SaaS Trap for Small Businesses:**
- 🎣 **Complex features** you'll never use
- 🎣 **Enterprise pricing** scaled down but not optimized
- 🎣 **Ongoing dependency** on their platform
- 🎣 **Data harvesting** of your employee information
- 🎣 **Contract lock-in** with cancellation penalties

## 📊 **5-Year Cost Comparison: SaaS vs. One-Time Purchase**

### **Cybersecurity SaaS ($200/month):**
- **Year 1**: $2,400
- **Year 2**: $2,400
- **Year 3**: $2,400
- **Year 4**: $2,400
- **Year 5**: $2,400
- **Total**: **$12,000**

### **One-Time Purchase Kit ($99):**
- **Year 1**: $99
- **Year 2**: $0
- **Year 3**: $0
- **Year 4**: $0
- **Year 5**: $0
- **Total**: **$99**

### **💡 Your Savings: $11,901 over 5 years**

## 🎯 **What 5-Person Companies Actually Need**

### **Essential Requirements (What Insurers Want):**
- ✅ **Security awareness training** for all staff
- ✅ **Documented security policies**
- ✅ **Incident response plan**
- ✅ **Risk assessment documentation**
- ✅ **Employee training records**

### **What SaaS Companies Sell You (That You Don't Need):**
- ❌ **Advanced threat detection** (overkill for 5 people)
- ❌ **AI-powered security analytics** (you have no data to analyze)
- ❌ **24/7 monitoring** (your team works 9-5)
- ❌ **Complex integration tools** (you use 3 software tools max)
- ❌ **Enterprise reporting dashboards** (you know everyone personally)

## 🔍 **The Reality of Small Business Security**

### **Your Actual Security Challenges:**
- **Phishing emails** targeting your team
- **Weak passwords** on shared accounts
- **Lost laptops** with company data
- **Insurance compliance** documentation
- **Basic data protection** for client information

### **What Actually Works:**
- **Regular staff training** (30 minutes quarterly)
- **Simple, clear policies** (2-3 pages max)
- **Documented procedures** (what to do when X happens)
- **Employee acknowledgment** (signed forms)
- **Annual review** (update policies as needed)

## 💼 **Real Small Business Examples**

### **Case Study: 5-Person Consulting Firm**
**SaaS Approach:**

- Features: AI threat detection, 24/7 monitoring, advanced analytics
- Reality: Team of 5, no IT department, simple email and document storage
- **Annual Cost: $3,000**

**One-Time Purchase Approach:**
- $99 cybersecurity kit with policies and training
- Features: Training materials, policies, checklists, documentation
- Reality: Same team, same security level, fully compliant
- **Annual Cost: $99 (first year only)**

**Result: Same compliance, $2,901 annual savings**

### **Case Study: 4-Person Marketing Agency**
**SaaS Approach:**
- $180/month "small business security platform"
- Features: Complex dashboard, weekly reports, threat intelligence

**One-Time Purchase Approach:**
- $99 cybersecurity kit

- **Enterprise mindset** applied to small businesses

### **What They Don't Want You to Know:**
- **You only use 10%** of their features
