Fake invoices. ‚ÄúCEO‚Äù wire requests. Supplier bank-detail changes. Most start with a fake sender. Here‚Äôs a simple guide to the two most common tricks‚Äîand a small-team playbook to block them fast.

## What‚Äôs the difference?

**Email spoofing (your domain is forged).** Attackers send mail that pretends to be `you@yourcompany.com`. You stop this with **SPF, DKIM, and DMARC**‚Äîstandards that tell receiving mail servers which senders are legit and how to handle fakes.

**Lookalike domains (a cousin domain is used).** Attackers register `yourcornpany.com` or `your-company.co` and email from there. Your domain settings can‚Äôt block that, so you reduce risk with **people/process controls** (visual checks, allow-lists, banners) and **basic domain hygiene** (locks, monitoring, buying obvious variants).

## A 7-Step Playbook for Small Teams

### 1) Turn on SPF, DKIM, and DMARC (with monitoring)
- Publish **SPF** for the services that send on your behalf (Microsoft 365/Google Workspace, marketing platform, helpdesk).
- Enable **DKIM** signing in each service.
- Add **DMARC** with `p=quarantine` while you fix gaps, then move to `p=reject` once aligned.
- Review **DMARC aggregate reports** to catch misconfigured senders.

### 2) Lock down your domain & DNS
- Turn on **registrar lock** and **MFA** on your domain registrar account.
- Limit who can change DNS. Document where SPF/DKIM/DMARC live so updates aren‚Äôt guesswork.

### 3) Make the real address visible
- Configure mail clients to show the **full sender address**, not just the display name.
- Add an **External sender** banner for messages from outside your domain.

### 4) Reduce lookalike confusion
- If affordable, buy the obvious **typo domains** (`.co`, hyphen/no-hyphen, plural/singular) and redirect to your real site.
- Ask your email security tool to **flag domains similar** to yours.

### 5) Tighten who can send ‚Äúas you‚Äù
- In Microsoft 365/Google Workspace, restrict who can **send-as** shared mailboxes (e.g., `billing@`, `sales@`).
- Remove **legacy SMTP** senders you don‚Äôt use. Keep an **approved senders list** per mailbox.

### 6) Add a ‚Äúverify-before-pay‚Äù rule
For bank-detail changes, urgent payments, or gift-card requests, **call a saved number** (not one in the email) to confirm.  
**No exceptions:** email alone is never enough for money movement.

### 7) Teach a 10-second check
- *Was I expecting this?*  
- *Is the domain exact?* (read it out loud)  
- Hover links before clicking; report anything odd to the shared security inbox.

## Quick FAQs

**Will DMARC stop all fake emails?**  
No‚ÄîDMARC blocks direct spoofing of your domain. Attackers can still use lookalike domains, so keep the process and training steps above.

**Do we need a fancy tool to start?**  
Not to begin. Most wins come from correctly setting SPF/DKIM/DMARC, turning on external banners, and enforcing a callback rule for money-related requests.
