Fake invoices. ‚ÄúCEO‚Äù wire requests. Supplier bank-detail changes. Most of these start with a fake sender. Here‚Äôs a simple guide to the two most common tricks‚Äîspoofing and lookalike domains‚Äîand a small-team playbook to block them fast.

What‚Äôs the difference?

Email spoofing (your domain is forged).
Attackers send mail that pretends to be from you@yourcompany.com. You stop this with SPF, DKIM, and DMARC‚Äîstandards that tell receiving mail servers which senders are legit and how to handle fakes.

Lookalike domains (a cousin domain is used).
Attackers register yourcornpany.com or your-company.co and email from there. Your domain settings can‚Äôt block that, so you reduce risk with people/process controls (visual checks, allow-lists, banners) and basic domain hygiene (locks, monitoring, buying obvious variants).

A 7-Step Playbook for Small Teams
1) Turn on SPF, DKIM, and DMARC (with monitoring)

Publish SPF for the services that send on your behalf (e.g., Microsoft 365/Google Workspace, marketing platform, helpdesk).

Enable DKIM signing in each service.

Add DMARC with p=quarantine while you fix gaps, then move to p=reject once aligned.

Review DMARC aggregate reports to catch misconfigured senders.

2) Lock down your domain & DNS

Enable registrar lock and MFA on your domain registrar account.

Limit who can change DNS. Document where SPF/DKIM/DMARC live so updates aren‚Äôt guesswork.

3) Make the real address visible

Configure mail clients to show the full sender address, not just the display name.

Add an ‚ÄúExternal sender‚Äù banner for messages from outside your domain to nudge caution.

4) Reduce lookalike confusion

If affordable, buy the obvious typo domains (.co, hyphen/no-hyphen, plural/singular) and redirect to your real site.

Ask your email security tool to flag domains that closely resemble yours.

5) Tighten who can send ‚Äúas you‚Äù

In Microsoft 365/Google Workspace, restrict who can send as shared mailboxes (e.g., billing@, sales@).

Remove legacy SMTP senders you don‚Äôt use. Keep a list of approved senders per mailbox.

6) Add a ‚Äúverify-before-pay‚Äù rule

For bank-detail changes, urgent payments, or gift-card requests, staff must call a saved number (not one in the email) to confirm.

No exceptions: email alone is never enough for money movement.

7) Teach a 10-second check

Was I expecting this?

Is the domain exact? (read it out loud)

Hover links before clicking; report anything odd to the shared security inbox.

Quick FAQs

Will DMARC stop all fake emails?
No‚ÄîDMARC blocks direct spoofing of your domain. Attackers can still use lookalike domains, so keep the process and training steps above.

Do we need a fancy tool to start?
Not to begin. Most wins come from correctly setting SPF/DKIM/DMARC, turning on external banners, and enforcing a callback rule for money-related requests.
