Permission creep is real: people change roles, vendors get added “just for a week,” and test accounts linger. A lightweight quarterly review keeps access lean, reduces audit headaches, and prevents avoidable incidents — without new tools or jargon.

## ✅ What You’ll Achieve (in ~20 minutes)
- Remove unused accounts and over-broad roles  
- Confirm MFA is on for every active user  
- Close out vendor/app access no longer needed  
- Produce a simple record that satisfies client/insurer audits

---

## �� Prep (5 minutes)

**Where to check:**  
- Identity & email: Google Workspace or Microsoft 365  
- Key apps: storage (Drive/SharePoint), finance, CRM, helpdesk, source control  
- Vendors: any third-party with logins or API keys

**What to export:**  
- **Active users list** (with last sign-in if available)  
- **Admins/owners** per app  
- **MFA status** per user (if visible)  

Tip: Save exports to a “_Access Review YYYY-Q#_” folder so you can compare quarter to quarter.

## 🪜 The 5-Step Review

### 1) Match people to access (Who still needs what?)
- Cross-check your **active staff/contractor list** against each app’s user list.  
- **Suspend** anyone who’s left (don’t delete yet; preserve data).  
- Remove guest/vendor accounts no longer needed.

> If you recently had a departure, run our offboarding checklist to avoid missed steps. See **Related Post** below.

### 2) Right-size roles (Default to least privilege)
- **Reduce** Admin/Owner roles that aren’t essential.  
- Swap “full access” shares for **folder/project-specific** access.  
- Confirm finance, HR, and client-data areas are **restricted**.

### 3) Check MFA coverage (Everyone, every app)
- Turn on **MFA** for accounts missing it.  
- Rotate **backup codes** for shared mailboxes or emergency access.  
- For app-specific tokens, note any that don’t support MFA and limit their scope.

### 4) Clean up old keys & shares
- Rotate stale **API keys** and disable test tokens.  
- Remove public or “anyone with the link” sharing.  
- Archive old vendor SSO/OAuth connections.

### 5) Record the outcome (Your audit receipt)
Log the date, who reviewed, the systems checked, changes made, and any follow-ups. A one-page note (or spreadsheet) is enough.

## 📝 Copy-Paste Log Template

- **Review date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
- **Reviewed by:** Name/Role  
- **Systems:** Workspace/M365, Storage, CRM, Finance, Helpdesk, Code, Other  
- **Actions taken:** (e.g., “Suspended 1 leaver, removed 2 vendor logins, reduced 3 admin roles, enabled MFA for 2 users, rotated 1 API key.”)  
- **Open items:** (owner + due date)

---

## 🧪 Quick Spot-Checks That Catch Most Issues
- **Admin count:** keep to the smallest practical number  
- **Last sign-in:** suspend accounts with 60–90 days inactivity (confirm with manager)  
- **Shared mailboxes:** restrict who can send-as; rotate credentials; enable MFA on owners  
- **Client folders:** verify only the current project team has access  
- **Finance apps:** confirm vendor accounts and bookkeepers still required

## 🙋 Common Questions

**How often is “enough” for small teams?**  
Quarterly works well. If you’re adding staff/contractors frequently, do a **monthly light pass**.

**Should we delete or suspend leavers?**  
**Suspend first** to preserve files and audit trails, then delete when retention obligations are met.

**Do we need a fancy tool?**  
Not to start. Export lists, review, act, log. Later you can automate exports or add alerts.
