Cybersecurity isn't just for big companies. In fact, small teams are often *easier* targets — and attackers know it. Yet too many founders and teams fall into false beliefs that create real risk.

Here are 7 myths we hear all the time — and how to stay protected.

## 1. 🪞 "We’re too small to be targeted"

**Reality:** Small businesses are often hit *because* they’re small. Fewer defenses, no IT team, and quick payouts make you attractive to attackers.

## 2. 🧾 "We don’t handle sensitive data"

**Reality:** You likely handle payroll, client emails, vendor accounts, or IP. Even login credentials have value on the dark web. Don’t underestimate what’s at risk.

## 3. 🧠 "Our staff already knows this stuff"

**Reality:** Awareness fades fast without reinforcement. One forgotten habit — like using public Wi-Fi without a VPN — can lead to a breach.

## 4. 🧰 "Antivirus is enough"

**Reality:** Antivirus helps, but it won’t stop phishing, poor password hygiene, or human error. Modern attacks rely on *behavior*, not just malware.

## 5. 🛜 "We use cloud tools, so we’re safe"

**Reality:** Cloud apps are only secure if you configure them correctly — MFA, password policies, and access controls are still your responsibility.

## 6. 💸 "We can’t afford cybersecurity"

**Reality:** You can’t afford *not* to. A single breach can cost weeks of downtime, lost clients, or GDPR fines. Most protections — like training and MFA — are low-cost or free.

## 7. ✅ "We did a training once, so we’re covered"

**Reality:** One-and-done training isn’t enough. Threats evolve. Insurers and regulators now expect ongoing awareness, logs, and proof of action.

## 📌 Bottom Line

Cybersecurity is about *habits* — not hardware. Busting these myths is your first step toward building resilience that scales with your business.
