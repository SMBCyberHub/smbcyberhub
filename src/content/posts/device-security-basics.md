Working remotely is here to stay — but without strong device security, your data is more exposed than ever. Whether you're logging in from a café or stepping away from your desk, a few simple habits can prevent major risks.

## 💻 Lock It Down: Laptop & Desktop Basics

Work devices hold sensitive data. Here’s how to lock them down:

- Use a strong login password (not just a screensaver)
- Always lock your screen (Win+L or Cmd+Ctrl+Q) before stepping away
- Set your device to auto-lock after 5–10 minutes
- Keep software updated — including your OS, browser, and key apps
- Encrypt your hard drive (e.g., BitLocker or FileVault)

## 📱 Phones and Tablets Deserve Protection Too

Phones often store work emails, logins, and documents. Treat them like laptops:

- Use a PIN, fingerprint, or Face ID to lock your device
- Turn off Bluetooth and AirDrop when not needed
- Enable remote wipe in case the device is lost
- Avoid jailbreaking or using unofficial apps

## 🌐 Remote Work? Don’t Skip These Wi-Fi Rules

Public and home Wi-Fi can expose your traffic to snoopers:

- Never use public Wi-Fi without a VPN
- Prefer personal mobile hotspots when traveling
- Don’t sync work files to personal cloud drives
- Only use work-approved devices and accounts

## 🚫 What NOT to Do (Yes, We’ve Seen These)

- Don’t leave laptops unattended in cars
- Don’t let family members use your work device
- Don’t share login details via email or chat
- Don’t use USB drives you didn’t purchase yourself

## 🧳 If Your Device Is Lost or Stolen…

Speed matters. Take these steps right away:

1. Change your passwords — especially email and cloud tools  
2. Use remote wipe if it’s enabled  
3. Notify your manager or IT contact  
4. Log the incident for compliance or insurance records

> “One lost laptop can equal full access to client files, emails, and apps.”

## ✅ Final Thought: Treat Every Device Like It’s a Filing Cabinet

If you wouldn’t leave sensitive papers on a café table, don’t leave your laptop unlocked or your files unencrypted. A few proactive steps go a long way.
